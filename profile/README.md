Lupa Digital is a project developed within the scope of the Arquivo.pt Awards 2025 competition, focused on intelligent metajournalism. Using artificial intelligence tools, the project analyzes thousands of news articles from the beginning of the digital era to uncover patterns, trends, and relevant insights on any topic.
